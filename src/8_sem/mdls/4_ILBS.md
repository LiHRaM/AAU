## Indoor LBS
It's easy to motivate location-based services.
People spend most of their time indoors.
Most of our shared venues are not only indoors, but also complex.

There are three main areas of research and development:
- Indoor LBS
- Indoor Mobility Data
- Indoor Flow Analysis

Some applications include:
- Indoor Route Sharing
- Warehouse Management
- Indoor Social and Recommendations

Technical challenges include:
- Space: Indoor spaces contain a lot of entities which affect indoor movements, these are hard to model using outdoor modelling
- Positioning: Indoor positioning is not as good as GPS currently, current methods are lacking
- Data: Modeling entities, points of interest, and trajectories.
