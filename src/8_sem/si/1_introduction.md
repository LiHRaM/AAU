# Software Innotvation


## Cyber Physical-cyber-human sytstems
- Digitalization shapes systems with these chracteristics.
  - Volatility, constant/ massive changes
  - Uncertainty, lack of predictability
  - Complexity, interrelated, powerful actors, building strong forces, difficulty in controlling them
  - Ambiguitity, cause and effect relationships between parts, how do they react with other parts.
  - 

## Why software innovation: Motivation and Purpose
### Motivation
- Development is an open-ended systems engineering process
- Calls for a problem oriented approach, due to increased complexity
- Tools for approaching open-ended problems
- Software is key part in any innovation.
- "no easy approaches to innovation" = im out <- Casa 2020.
- add more value to products in a competitive world.
### purpose
- Insight into theories and methods, tools for software innovation and innovation processes.

## Course contents
### Academeic:
- Elements from Software Engineering, systems development, tech management, innovation management, philosophy

### Readings, slides, exercises
- Exercises are used for mini-projects. message ivan for help (lul)
## Mini-project 
- type A
  - Prepared in groups
  - 8-12 pages long (based on group size)
  - is not graded, but used at exam
  - Can be used in semester project as well (without plagiarism)
    - Should cover:
    - Brief description of the problem
    - Results from exercise work
    - Theoretical evaluation
- Type B
  - Pretty much standard oral-exam stuff.A
  - Randomly chosen question (from 20 available)
  - presentation about question, then general discussion.

- No matter what, exam is oral, one is more based on mini-project, thus a bit easier to "control".

### Some first distinctions
- Main emphasis on innovative products (and processes)
- Basic Terms
  - Creativity - a state of mind which leads to inventive or innovative thinking
  - Invention - e.g a new algorithm, new use of data, or program
  - Innovation - Creative act and invention carried into wider use.
    - "The successful exploitation of new ideas"

### Dimensions of innovation:
- Different levels of innovation:

- Component level vs system level
  - An improvement to a component vs new version of a whole system
- Incremental
  - New components for existing systems, vs advanced materials to improve component performance.
### Innovation space

- No idea what to write here :() <- tror vi mangler lidt af billedet. 

### Levels of study
- At a global, national, regional
- Industrywide,  corporation, company, branch
- Software project

# A paper:
Conboy, K. & Morgan, L. (2010). Future Research in Agile Systems Development: Applying Open Innovation Principles Within the Agile Organisation
- Rare, might be difficult to find
- think we should have read it before lecture (whoopsies)

## Starting point
- Agile moves away from introverted development and involve the customer across all stages of development
- Intended to support innovation and value-creation
- However, a single customer cannot fully encompass a whole solution (scope too narrow)
- Current thinking: Agile needs to be extended to include multiple stakeholders outside the business unit.

## Purpose of agile
- Explore intra-organizational applications and implications of open innovation in agile systems development
- Argue for a different perspective of project management that incldues collaboration and knowledge sharing:
  - WIth other Business units, customers, partners, other relevant stakeholders pertinent to the success of an organization

## Agile and creativity
- Creativity is the production of appropriate, adaptive novel work.
  - Should play a role in ALL aspects of IT development
- Agile users believe: "Creativity, not voluminous written rules, is the only way to mange complex software development problems".

## Organizational levels
- Inter organizational: Relations across company boundaries
- Intra: Relations inside the company
- Innovation outside the business unit, rather than outside a company (page 6 in the paper)

### Close to open innovation
#### Closed innovation
- Experts in the company invent within th ecompany
- Closed innovation assumes innovation requires control and self reliance, due to uncertainty about quality about external actors work.

#### Open innovation
- Smart people work outside the company (also inside)
- External R&D is significant value, internal claims some of that value
- We can profit from research that isnt ours.
- Better business model is better than first to market

Three open innovation archetypes:
- Outside-in
  - Integration of external knowlegde from outside the business unit
- Inside-out
  - Leveraging and transfering knowledge to stakeholders outside the business unit. Gaining advantages from this flow to the outside
- Coupled process
  - Combination of the above two. We both take from external actors, and in return give them knowledge.

### Contributions of the paper
- Argues about open innovation complementing agile approaches
- Points to some problems in the project management practices ( knowledge sharing not supported)
- Argues for stronger focus on collaboration and knowledgesharing with external actors
