## Case Study: Duty to investigate Lawfulness of Processing w.r.t. recipient
There was a case where the government requested that a bank give 3 years' worth of transfers from a private citizen's bank accounts.
The request was made in order to determine if the citizen was avoiding taxes and receiving official compensation illegally.
The government's argument for lawfulness of processing was incorrectly cited, but the bank transferred the information anyway.
The citizen filed a complaint, but Datatilsynet's verdict was that when the government requests such data, the lawfulness of processing need not be investigated thoroughly.
