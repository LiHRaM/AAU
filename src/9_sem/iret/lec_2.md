## Controller vs. Processor

From [Article 4 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/):

> (7) ‘controller’ means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;

> (8) ‘processor’ means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;

### Examples

#### Reparation of Copy Machine
If a company hires an external contractor to fix a copy machine with a hard disk, there is no agreement on processing, therefore the contractor should sign an NDA, that's all.

#### Mounting of Door Handle
If a contractor is given personal information (such as the address of a customer), he is an independent controller, because they have the freedom to decide how to handle the data they are given for a task.

## Processing Contract
[Article 28, section 3](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) documents the minimum requirements for a valid processing contract.
1. processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller
2. Select staff which requires access
3. persons authorized have _committed to confidentiality_ or are _under obligation of confidentiality_.


## Principles relating to processing of personal data
[Article 5, section 2](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) documents the bare minimum responsibilities of the controller, which include being able to demonstrate compliance with the responsibilities.
