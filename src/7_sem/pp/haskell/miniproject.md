# Haskell - Miniproject
The Haskell miniproject has the goal of implementing the Huffman encoding algorithm.

## The Assignment
- Read an arbitrary text from input
- Compute the optimal prefix code from input based on the frequency of its characters
- Compress the input string and return the compressed version in an appropriate way
- Decompress a bit sequence known to be written using a specific prefix code and write the decompressed text to output
