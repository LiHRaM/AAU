## Testing Concepts

When discussing types of tests, there are several axes to consider.
- **Size**
    - *Unit*: A single unit is tested.
    - *Integration*: The interaction of two or more units is tested.
- **Knowledge**
    - *Blackbox*: The tester does not know how the code works.
    - *Whitebox*: The tester is aware of the internals of the code.
- **Running**
    - *Static*: The test is performed without running code.
    - *Dynamic*: The test is performed by running code.
